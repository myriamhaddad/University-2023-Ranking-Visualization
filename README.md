## Dependencies
- d3.js: A JavaScript library for data visualization.
- topojson : An extension of GeoJSON that encodes topology.
- pandas : A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- fuzzywuzzy : A Python library for fuzzy string matching.


## Data
This web visualization is based on the Global University Rankings Dataset 2023 from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joyshil0599/global-university-rankings-dataset-2023). 

The dataset was merged ussing the fuzzywuzzy library with the country to continent dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/statchaitya/country-to-continent?resource=download) in the preprocessing.ipynb notebook to obtain the region of each university.

The covered regions in our visualization are namely :   
['Northern Europe', 'Northern America', 'Western Europe',
       'South-Eastern Asia', 'Eastern Asia', 'Australia and New Zealand',
       'Western Asia', 'Southern Africa', 'Southern Europe',
       'South America', 'Eastern Europe', 'Southern Asia',
       'Western Africa', 'Northern Africa', 'Eastern Africa', 'Caribbean',
       'Central America', 'Central Asia', 'Melanesia'].
